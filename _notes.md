# Notes

## Using https://jules.google.com/

## Download latest APK
https://github.com/jmasalma/AdhanAlarm2/releases/latest


## Increment tag

```bash

git pull --prune
latest_tag=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
new_tag=$(echo "$latest_tag" | awk -F'.' -v OFS='.' '{$NF++; print $0}')
echo Moving tag from ${latest_tag} to ${new_tag}

git tag ${new_tag}
git push origin --tags

```



## ToDo


Can you do the following:
- Make 4x4 widget into a 3x4 
- Make "Version: 3.0" text in Setting Information section to pull version number from git based on latest tag 
- request notification permission on app first start similar to location permission
 - Change app so notification permissions is requested when app first starts similar to location permission.  Currently I only get location permission, after closing and reopening the app I get the notification permission.

- add count down on notification


### Fixs
Done - when the app first starts after being installed or data cleared, the today tab is empty.  It populates after I go to settings an click get GPS Location
Done - Fix deprecated calls:
Done - w: file:///home/runner/work/AdhanAlarm2/AdhanAlarm2/app/src/main/java/islam/adhanalarm/MainViewModel.kt:7:47 'LocalBroadcastManager' is deprecated. Deprecated in Java
Done - w: file:///home/runner/work/AdhanAlarm2/AdhanAlarm2/app/src/main/java/islam/adhanalarm/MainViewModel.kt:80:9 'LocalBroadcastManager' is deprecated. Deprecated in Java
Done - Fix fajr and ishaa prayer times
Done - show hijri date in today tab in the app, in default language
Done - Add build date and latest version tag to the information section at the bottom of the setting page
Done - Setting to update long/lat once permissions are granted.
- check and fix notifications as they seem to trigger at wrong times (extra triggers)
- auto pick version in info section from git
- use targetCellWidth and targetCellHeight instead of minWidth and minHeight for widgets

### Fix notifications
Done - Remove it
Done - Ask AI to add it again
Done ? - seems to be working now! - Not working, could be because latest android does not show notifications form sideloaded app, try on an older android...
Done - Dismiss the before notification when next prayer time notification happens
- request notification permission on app first start similar to location permission
Done - update small notification count down and show seconds as well...
Done - Make sure countdown is updated live

### Fix widgets
Done - Remove it and then ask AI to add it again.
Done - Make sure widget is updated when something changes in the app setting, e.g. GPS location, calculation method, etc.
Done - Make widget style/color to match app
? - Adjust size of widgets so the text shrinks and grows based on size of the widget.
Done - Make smaller widget match app style and make it a 1x1 if possible
Done - Make larger widget default to 4x4
Done - reformat 1x1 widget
Done - show count down to next prayer in 1x2 widget
- adjust 4x4 widget to be slightly narrower
Done - clicking on widget should open the app




### Fix automatic calculation method by region
Done - Make ISNA the default calculation method
- Fix so the right calculation method is used per region automatically

### Remove localization, english only for now...
Done - Can add it later...
- start with arabic, etc.

### Harden
Done - Add tests
Done - Add code inline docs
